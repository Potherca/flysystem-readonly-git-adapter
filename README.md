Flysystem Adapter Decorator to work locally with a remote git repository

This is a proof-of-concept and architecture/design repository for 
[an idea](https://twitter.com/mvriel/status/593656999784685568) that
[Mike van Riel](https://twitter.com/mvriel/) and [Potherca](http://pother.ca) 
had in regards to creating a (readonly) git adapter for [FlySystem](flysystem.thephpleague.com)

Comments are welcome, just [create an issue](https://github.com/potherca/POC-flysystem-readonly-git/issues/new)
